To add an image to a Jekyll post, follow these steps:

1. Place the image file in a directory within your Jekyll site, such as `/assets/images/`. [1]

2. In the post's markdown file, use the following syntax to reference the image:

```
![Alt text for the image](/assets/images/image_file.jpg)
```

Replace `/assets/images/image_file.jpg` with the correct relative path to your image file. [2]

3. Optionally, you can define the image path in the post's front matter using a custom variable, e.g.:

```
---
layout: post
title: My Post
image: /assets/images/image_file.jpg
---
```

Then reference it in the markdown using `![Alt text](%20page.image%20)`. [1]

4. If your site is hosted in a subdirectory, you may need to prepend the image path with `%20site.baseurl%20` or use the `relative_url` filter, e.g.:

```
![Alt text](%20%22/assets/images/image_file.jpg%22%20%7C%20relative_url%20)
```

This ensures the image path is correct when your site is built. [3]

By following these steps, your image should display correctly in your Jekyll post. [1][2][3]
