Hello and welcome!

## About Me

I am:

* a pilgrim
* a seeker on the way
* a writer
* a guide dog partner
* sometimes I'm funny
* sometimes I'm serious

## What You Will Find Here

Here @rillwrites, topics can vary wildly. Blogs are a way for me to talk to myself. You may find some things I write of use to you. My suggestion is to read what you like and skip the rest.
