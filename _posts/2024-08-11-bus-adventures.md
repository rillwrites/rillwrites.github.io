Writing about Nina is long overdue. I started a detailed post a while back, but didn't finish it. That's tomorrow's project.
Today I want to describe some bus adventures we have had.

The county bus system announces stops. This is very handy as the announcements tell when transfers are possible and to what bus lines. However, they are often hard to hear or not working. Today a loud woman sat right next to me and talked with a man across the aisle. I could not hear the announcements over her. Fortunately, she left the bus before my stop.

Three of us waited for the bus this morning. Our bus never came, but
when the next bus did, One of the gentlemen directed me to the bus
that stopped out in the traffic lane. He made sure he was between me and a large pot hole.

Lasst Thursday, I transferred to the 63 bus. Again, I had trouble with the announcement so couldn't pull the cord for my stop. Happily, people were getting on so the bus stopped.

Next, I had to deal with crossing a right turn lane. I pressed the button, but it is not audible. I had difficulty figuring out when it was my turn to cross. I wasn't picking up the traffic surges. Finally, a lady waiting for the bus across the street called over for me to walk and to hurry. She instructed me when to stop on the sidewalk to wait for the bus.

The driver was very helpful when I got on the bus, but then we stopped to change drivers. It took a long time. When we finally got going again, the announcements quickly cut out. I thought at first there were just no stops. I hadn't taken this bus before. Then I hoped my grandson would be waiting and the bus would stop. Should I ask the bus at large to pull the cord? I turned on my GPS and waited. I learned I had already passed my stop and we were at the mall--the end of the line.

As I prepared to exit the bus, I told the driver her announcements were not working. She protested that she did not control the announcements. I said I knew that, but she should report it because I missed my stop and would have to text my family.

On her own initiative, the driver told me to sit back down and she would start back right away and find my stop. She did.

Happily, with all these adventures, I was never at risk.
