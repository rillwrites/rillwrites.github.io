I haven't worked with Android for most of this week because I have had a long excursion to investigate Jekyll, git and github pages.

I can create and commit a file for this blog on Github Mobile. I can't push it. I'm still have pushing using Android to investigate.

As a result, I have been working in Linux on my ChromeBook which also involved learning more about my ChromeBook. It also produced a duplicate file. Here's why and how I fixed it:

1. I used the Github Mobile app to create a commit a file. I typed the title of the post with each word capitalized.
2. I copied the text of this post and created a markdown file with its text and did not capitalize anything in the file name.
3. When the blog was generated, both files appeared. I did not realize for a long time that these were the same contents with different file names. I could not hear the capitalization issue and thought I had a duplicate that wasn't in a list of my files on the hard drive of my Chromebook.
4. I was able to locate the file and delete it using the github web site on my Chromebook.
Live and learn for sure.
