I have been experimenting with my phone to see which tasks make sense and which tasks are better on my iPhone.


Here are my findings so far:


1. I prefer to listen to podcasts on my iPhone. Although the player doesn’t have a rewind button immediately, I can stream through my hearing aids and subscribe to podcasts directly in the app if that option is offered.
2. My results are mixed on Zoom calls, but I will likely go back to using my iPad for this. The view for others is better with the phone in landscape mode which makes it hard to find the mute and unmute control. The Pixel 6A that I am using gets very hot during a long call. A cooler running tablet may change my mind.
3. I set up Be My Eyes and that worked well for identification.
I continue to explore writing options. I need to be able to post to
Github. I will investigate this next.
