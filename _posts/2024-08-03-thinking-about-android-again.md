
I've been sitting too much, listening too much. Having a computer project doesn't help with the sitting, but it focuses my mind in a very different way. I like problem solving and the sense of accomplishment when something works.


Recently, I tried to pair a bluetooth speaker with my raspberry pi. Ultimately, I was unsuccessful, but the process stimulated my interest in a technology project.


I came across an article about using an Android tablet as a productivity tool. My first Android device was a Nexis 7 tablet. I loved it. I used Android phones for a long time. I turned away from Android when I couldn't get it to tell me where I was when I got lost. It showed me a map rather than giving me an address. As I could not see the map, I was still very lost. An address would have helped me out.


The article I read was about using an Android tablet with a keyboard. I was very excited as the blind user indicated he was doing this successfully. My immediate reaction was to find out how much his tablet and keyboard cost. Then I realized I could easily use my Android phone with a keyboard as I am not using it as a phone. I have my iPhone for that.


At the moment, the three big reasons I am sticking with the iPhone are:


 1. My Washington Post ad free subscription for their news podcast only works
   in Apple Podcasts.
 2. I do not have a Voice Dream Reader alternative. I use it most for
 saving web content as text. Recipes are my most significant pages
 here.
 3. It may go without saying that I am far more efficient with my iPhone than my Android phone.


And before I go on, let me say that I could go back to using PocketCast. I'm just lazy and there's a little more management than I'd like.


So to get this Android usage exploration going, I'm going to focus on writing. The more I can use a phone or a tablet, the less I need to use my computer.


I will need to learn how to edit documents efficiently and review smaller pieces of text.


## Why do I need a computer anyway?


I've given up on email unless I absolutely have to use it on a computer. Microsoft took away Windows Mail which I like. I can't figure Outlook out. This may be my failing, but why does an email app need to be so hard? I just want to read and send email and I want a unified inbox. I have that on my phone. After writing, email should probably be my next Android focus.


The two items which are currently essential that I do on my computer are:


1. Convert PDF files to text.
2. Convert text files to Braille.


A future Android project might be how to read PDF files for Morning Prayer on my Android device, but that's a way down the priority list. Some of the PDF files I use on a regular basis are not formatted by professionals so they need a fair amount of processing to be usable and then I sometimes still need help to get the recipe right.


OK. I need to figure out editing and exporting. And yes, managing Github would be another item on my computer list.
