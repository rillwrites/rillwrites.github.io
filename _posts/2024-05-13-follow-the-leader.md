It was a beautiful morning. I took Nina outside. I put
her on a tether to groom her.
When our instructor arrived, Nina greeted him but decided to hang out
by me--a good sign.Then we blew her mind.
I always have arm position trouble with a new dog. This is
particularly pronounced now because Nina is 18 pounds lighter than
Nick was and much shorter. Our instructor held the front of the
harness and the leash to simulate the dog while I also held the leash
and the harness handle. We walked up and down on the sidewalk while
Nina watched us. It helped me a lot.
Then, amidst the Monday morning lawn mower racket, we set out for the
park. We are still working together--all three  of us--to have Nina
maintain a steady fast pace with good control. I learned Nina freezes
while distracted--a dog, a bicycle and some kids. There's a snow
shovel on the path and the ever-present Monday lawn mowing machines.

We are still mulling over what to do about the bus. It seems risky to
cross six lanes without a clear notion of when to start to cross. The
"island" is only a small patch in the middle of the street and if I
stop at the wrong point, I could be in the middle of a
lane. Furthermore, cars can see the light turn green enough in advance
that they would be moving too fast if I was still in their lane. We
are thinking it might be advisable, since I am not a daily commuter,
to ride the bus to the end of the line, wait, and then come south
again, getting off on my side of the street. (My intersection is so
dinky it will probably take decades to get an audible signal
installed.)

Because of rain we decided to do some indoor work and went to
Walmart. We practiced three navigational items:

1. Use a shopping cart. I hold the handle and manage Nina behind the
   cart. It is important for the sighted person to make allowance for
   Nina's feet when turning left.
2. Our instructor created and found obstacles for us to navigate. Nina
   had to evaluate if we could go around obstacles or if she needed to
   stop and wait for more instructions. The dog has to judge how wide
   we are as a team.
3. We played follow the leader. Nina has to be told who she is
   following. The leader has to walk in front but not so fast that
   they lose Nina. Slapping the side of the knee helps to keep Nina
   focused on the leader especially with quick turns. We weaved all
   over Walmart.
   
   Later we evaluated dog treats and dog toys and found most in each
   category wanting.
   
   We also reviewed the gentle leader which can calm a dog and give
   the handler more control. This is very helpful in the pet aisles. I
   took Nina out of gentle leader jail at the clearence racks. She was
   calmer and tolerated shopping until she thought it was getting to
   be dinner time.
   
   Getting in and out of the SUV is challenging. Running boards and
   handles help me. Nina can jump. I need to get her in before
   swivelling in the seat to put my feet in last. It's a tight fit.
   
   When we got home, I suggested I solo to get into the house from the
   parking lot. Nina found the stairs and the door just fine.
   
   Nina decided to play. Jumping, racing around the house with her
   toy, flopping on her back and chewing on her soft toys.
