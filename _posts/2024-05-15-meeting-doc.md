Our instructor wanted us to practice getting on the bus and scanning
the QR code for payment. I have to open the app and bring up the code
before the bus arrives then tell Nina to "find the bus". Make sure
both of us are all the way onto the bus then find the box on the pole
on the other side of Nina. So the dog is in my left hand and the phone
is in my right. Hear the beep that payment has been received. "Nina,
find a seat." Sit down and tell Nina "under" to get her settled on the
bus. I prefer to have her between my feet rather than next to me.

I don't always hear the announcements of potential stops well so I
will have to have my GPS running while onboard.

We got off at a very busy intersection--too busy to cross
independently. We went to a grocery store. I thought the
acousticss and the music might bother Nina, but they didn't.

When we boarded the bus to go home, Nina was very distracted and did
not find me a seat. Turns out, there was a service dog with another
person. His name was Doc. When Doc and his person got off, I was told
to guard Nina's feet as her wheelchair was a heavy one. No
worries. Everything was fine.

Nina appears to be in a bit of a daze after getting off the bus. I
have to get her focused with a few obedience exercises.
