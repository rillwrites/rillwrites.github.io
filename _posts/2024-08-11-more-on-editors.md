I was just about to write a post on what editor I have settled on when I discovered Notily.

I reviewed the apps on
[AccessibleAndroid](https://accessibleandroid.com/). So far, it's been good.

Advantages:

* It works natively on my phone. No Internet is required.
* I can share my notes to Google Drive.

Disadvantage:

* It does not support markdown.

However, this disadvantage is mitigated by Google Docs now supporting markdown in three ways:

1. I can write and edit a Google Doc with markdown.
2. Google Drive respects the .md extension and opens the document in Google Docs.
3. I can download any document I create in Google Docs as a markdown file.

I am also learning how to download the Google cloud file to my
Chromebook and copy it in the files app to the Linux container. This
is still a very shaky process for me but I will persevere.
