I have worked with guide dogs for over 30 years:

* Caitlin, chocolate Lab, 1994-2006;
* Elwood, yellow Lab, 2006-2016;
* Nick, yellow Lab, 2016-2023.

There were several months of doglessness between Caitlin and Elwood and Elwood and Nick. Because Nick's death was unexpected, the wait between dogs has been longer.

I went away to school for several weeks for these three dogs. In thinking about going back to school for another dog, I decided working with another organization which trains in my area had many advantages:

1. No travel for me.

2. Orientation in my own neighborhood.

3. Training specific to my own needs. At a school, the training program must cover as many eventualities as possible.

4. One on one training.

5. I eat a specialized diet. No explaining to others necessary.

6. No need to navigate difficult relationships with strangers.

The down side, of course, is that I won't make any friends. I made a lasting one when I got Elwood. I miss Linda all the time!

7. Because the interview and assessment were done last fall, the training time is shortened.

I hope we will start on Friday.
