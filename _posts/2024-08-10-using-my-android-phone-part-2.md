My focus for these last couple of days has been on my blog. Github has distracted me from my initial purpose which continues to be to use my Android phone as a tablet. I still want to use it as my primary writing tool.

For my blog, Google Keep appears to be the best candidate for a text editor. Unfortunately, I don’t see how to download content from there so I’m sending it to Google docs. This is not ideal since this is a proprietary format. I can easily access content from my Chromebook to put to Github. It remains to be seen if I can directly upload content to Github from ChromeOS as the Chromebook is often seen as a mobile device.

After my brush with my remote and local copies of my blog being out of synch, I have to remember to pull my repository first before pushing the new content in order for it to appear on my blog.

Advantages of using my Android phone for writing:

* It's fairly distraction free. I am not as tempted to pick it up to do something else. When I'm writing, I'm writing.  
* The writing experience is frankly more intuitive. The tab key acts
  as expected and the few keyboard shortcuts I currently know behave
  as they do on Linux or Windows, the operating systems I know best. I've never come to grips with using iOS with a keyboard. I had the same problem with a Mac though I tried and tried to learn how to use it effectively.

Compared to a laptop, an Android phone and a keyboard are certainly more portable. If this becomes a regular habit, I will need a good portable keyboard, I think.

There is one significant impediment to using my phone as a portable writing machine--my hearing aids. I am currently using hearing aids which cannot pair to both my iOS devices and my Android phone. My old ones could do this. I am wondering if there is a way to pair the new ones with my Android device or should I use the old ones for this purpose.

Using the old ones will be fine at home. I mostly switched from using them because of battery issues. They were not lasting the whole day. The new ones have clearer sound so I am happy with my purchase.

Switching hearing aids to write introduces the physical necessity of
swapping one set out for another twice. As hearing aids are small,
they can be dropped or misplaced and I wouldn't want to be scrambling around trying to find a missing device. They're expensive\! That aside, I'm thinking about it
