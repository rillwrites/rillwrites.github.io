Today we worked on many things:
1. Going over commands. Some are the same for me and some are
   different. I'm using *Stay* instead of *rest*, for example. We
   practiced these.   
2. We discovered the ergonomic harness was too long for me. We need
      a shorter one.
3. We went for two walks.
4. We are practicing being off leash in the house. Nina is doing
         wonderfully.
5. We learned about grooming while relaxing on the large
            patio.
			
			### Our Walks
			
			It was a bit challenging with the incorrect harness, but
            we managed.
			
			In the morning we went up to the park and did two times
            around the loop. Nina can walk quite spritely, clip clop,
            clip clop.
			It is realy good to be walking quickly and confidently.
			
			In the afternoon we went down the hill to the main
            road. There is an audible signal there though it is laid
            out strangely as the button is several steps away and
            across the sidewalk from the button. Nina and I both did
			well.
			
			### Wrapping Up
			
			Nina is very definite about dinnertime. Both of us are
            tired out.
